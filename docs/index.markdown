Chancery is a library for procedurally generating text and data in Common
Lisp.  It's heavily inspired by [Tracery][].

Chancery can be installed with [Quicklisp][]: `(ql:quickload :chancery)`

Chancery focuses on simplicity, correctness, and usability.  Performance is not
*terrible*, but is not a high priority.

It is currently not thread-safe, but this may happen in the future.
