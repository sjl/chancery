Chancery is a library for procedurally generating data in Common Lisp.  It has
some extra support for strings, and is heavily inspired by [Tracery][].

Chancery focuses on simplicity, correctness, and usability.  Performance is not
*terrible*, but is not a high priority.

It is currently not thread-safe, but this may happen in the future.
